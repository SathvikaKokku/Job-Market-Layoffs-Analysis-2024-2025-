# Job-Market-Pulse-Layoffs-Analysis-2024-2025-
An interactive dashboard analyzing global tech layoffs in 2024–2025 using Python, SQL, and Tableau to uncover company, country, and time-based trends.

Over the past year, I’ve seen friends, peers, and professionals around the world affected by ongoing layoffs - especially in tech. It made me wonder:

❓ What does the global layoff landscape actually look like in 2024–2025?

❓ Which companies are most affected? Are there patterns across countries or months?

To explore these questions, I built a data-driven project combining:

🐍 Python - for cleaning and preparing real-time data from Layoffs.fyi

🧠 SQL - to dig into top companies, monthly trends, and global patterns

📊 Tableau - to bring the insights to life through an interactive visual dashboard

I used all three together because:
✅Python handled the raw, unstructured data that couldn’t go straight into visualization

✅SQL allowed me to manipulate structured data efficiently and scale insights with simple logic

✅Tableau gave me the flexibility to present everything in an intuitive, story-first format

Final outcome:
📉 Layoffs Over Time (split by month and year)

🏢 Top Companies by Layoffs (Tesla, Intel, Microsoft…)

🌍 Country-wise Layoff Trends (U.S., U.K., India, and more)

🎯 My goal was to make something timely, relevant, and useful - especially for job seekers and analysts trying to make sense of today’s job market.
